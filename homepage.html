		     <p>My most recent adventure took me to Phoenix, Arizona. A family friend wedding took me more specicifically to  Apache Junction. MORE DETAILS TO COME  </p>
			 <h2>Trip Highlights</h2>
			 <ul>  <!--format lists T2-->
			     <li>The weather was beautiful the entire time we were there. It felt like a warm day in May while back in Charlotte it was raining and 30 degrees</li>
				 <li>The <a href="https://btarboretum.org/" target="_blank">Boyce Thompson Arboretum </a> was amazing to walk through and explore. There were over 10 different desert gardens from around the world.
				 We found the hike through the cannoyon the most breathtaking. An easy trail for novice hikers who just want to get out in nature.</li> <!--Find a link to their page, also include a picture or two -->
				 <li>The resturants we went too were all homeruns. One resturant we ended up visiting multiple times was in <a href="https://tempemarketplace.com/" target="_blank"> Tempe Marketplace </a>which is in Tempe AZ, only 10 minutes from our hotel.
				 The resturant we liked the most was called <em>The Thirsty Lion</em></li> 
				 <li>The wedding we traveled for was in Apache Junction, 30 minutes outside the Tempe/Phoenix area. The small town is situated right under a huge mesa that towered over us. 
				 No picture would ever do it justice but it didnt stop me from taking endless pictures.</li>

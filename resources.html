	    <h3>Discount Stress-free Booking</h3> 
		<p><a href="justfly.com" target="_blank">Justfly.com</a><br />
		Whenever I am planning a trip, I like to use this site. Its also an app you can also access on your phone. This website connects you with the best deals at any given time for flights, hotels, and car rentals. Although some are wary of third-party booking I have found my experience with the site to
		smooth and stress-free. The website books directly with the airline or hotel you want and whenever you need assistance or if plans change, they get you in touch with the right person to handle your case.
		One time I missed my flight and instead of leaving me stranded in another part of the U.S, they got me in touch with an American Airline representivtive who was able to get me one the next flight home.</p>

	    <h2>Navigating TSA</h2>
		<p>Flying is always a stressful event if you do not come properly prepared. It feels like rules are always changing and getting more complicated.
		<br />
		<strong>Here are a few things I have picked up along the way</strong></p>
		<p class="tips"><strong>Always trust the flight information on the screens INSIDE the airport above any app or printed plane ticket.</strong>
			<br /> 
			Everyone knows,(<em>and for those who dont</em>) gates in the airport are always shuffling. You never get a warning when they switch or why but if you dont keep your head on a swivle they are quick to leave you behind.
			This happened to me while getting checked into our flight from Arizona to Charlotte. Our printed tickets AND the TV outside of the airport had the gate number B24, which means concourse B, but once we got to the airport the flight info on our app said otherwise. After 
			much debate that was largly due to the fact that our new gate was in D20 which was on the opposite side of the airport, I defaulted to asking an attendent who worked in the airport. He explained to me that as a common rule, whenever gates update, the most accurate updates come from inside the airport (past TSA) 
			because the airlines first priority is to inform the airport where they are landing or parking. Apps and external information portals are usually the last to get these sometimes urgent updates.</p>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<p class="tips"><strong>Sometimes if a flight is close to full, the airline will start offering to checkin carry-on bags for free. </strong>I say sometimes because although it happens to me almost consistantly I dont want to speak for every airline. Checking a bag usually costs about $30 or more and invovles retriving it from a baggage carousel when you arrive at your destination. Carry on bags
			are small enough to fit above your head in the compartments. If the flight is close to full the airline will likely (but not always) offer to check backs complimentry in order to not risk having no more space left.</p>
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<p class="tips"><strong>RealID.</strong> Real ID is an updated form of federal identification that will be required in order to fly domestically as of May 7, 2025. The Department of Homeland Security says this about how to obtain your RealID before the deadline "<em>At a minimum, you must provide documentation showing: 1) Full Legal Name; 2) Date of Birth; 3) Social Security Number; 4) Two Proofs of Address of Principal Residence; and 5) Lawful Status. 
			States may impose additional requirements, so check with your state’s driver’s licensing agency website, before visiting them in person, for additional guidance and assistance.</em>"</p>
		
		<p class="tips">Lastly, there is lots of rules about bag sizes, liquid allowance for things like beauty products, hair products, and bringing anything back from your destination. TSA says you are allowed one Quart-size bag of liquids, aerosols, gels, and creams in your carry-ons. Each product should be in containers 3.4 ounces or less. </p>
		<img src="https://www.tsa.gov/sites/default/files/liquidsrule_example-outlined.svg" / class="TSA">
		<p>As far as your baggage, measurements for what is considered a carry-on and what size bags must be checked differs from airline to airline and is not regulated by TSA but rather by the individual airline. The average luggage size is 22 X 14 X 9 inches, and weight restrictions vary.</p>

	    <h2>Trip Advisor</h2>
		<p>There are plenty of local and national websits that tell you everything you need to know about places all over the USA and the rest of the world. TripAdvior happens to be my favorite of the websites. 
		Not only is it usually one of the first search results, but the website also features experiences which I think is important. The range from wine vineyards in small town, USA to Dubai ATV rentals is so impressive. There are tons of online reviews and price ranges readily available to you.
		I use this site mostly for resturant exploration and reviews, and finding local events and activities that are unique to the area.</p>
